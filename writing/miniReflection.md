After spending enough time to get familiar withh the SymPy tutorial, please address the following questions.

---

 1. Describe three helpful things that you could apply to SymPy to complete a mathematical component of your course project or in another mathematical work.

 2. Please offer basic (example) code to demonstrate each finding. This code could be taken directly from the tutorial provided that you offer the webpage link as a citation.

 3. In many cases, you could just as easily code some solution to provide a floating-point result, however, scientists still gravitate to math symbolic libraries for computational work. Why are these libraries popular for solving intensive types of mathematical applications?
